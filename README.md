# Big Sales Data Prediction (YBI Foundation Internship Project)

### Two-Month Data Science Internship Project

---

## Objective
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for sales forecasting using machine learning techniques.  
The project leverages **RandomForest Regressor** to predict future sales performance based on historical data.

---

## Data Source
- **Dataset:** Big Sales Data.csv (provided during the YBI Foundation internship)  
- **Size:** 12,000+ rows of retail sales data  
- **Features:** Product attributes, store-level information, and historical sales values  

---

## Methodology
### Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values  
- Label encoding of categorical features  
- Standardization and cleaning  

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution plots using Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Correlation heatmaps for feature importance  
- Outlier detection  

### Model Building
- **Algorithm:** RandomForestRegressor  
- Hyperparameter tuning for better acc
